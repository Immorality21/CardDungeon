# Balancing playbook

Accumulated **learnings** from tuning passes — the arithmetic that constrains the dials, which
lever does what, the workflow that measures instead of guessing, and the ceilings already hit.

Read this before touching a `Difficulty`, a `StatScale`, a hero bar or a spawn table. It exists so
a tuning pass starts from what was already measured rather than re-deriving it.

  `Assets/Scripts/Balance/CLAUDE.md`
- **What is still open** → the `§0` section of `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`
- **This file** is the *how*: the relationships between levers, and the mistakes already made.

---

## 1. The arithmetic you cannot tune around

Everything below follows from two identities. Internalise them and most "why won't this level
behave" questions answer themselves.

```
danger  ≈  ttk × dpt / partyHP          (time-to-kill × damage-per-turn)
attrition ≈ Σ danger over enemy instances
```

**Consequence 1 — danger *is* total damage dealt over a lifetime.** An enemy's danger index is
proportional to how much damage it lands before it dies. There is no way to make one enemy more
threatening without it costing the party more HP.

**Consequence 2 — mean per-enemy danger × enemy count = the level's attrition.** So *enemy count
is the only lever on whether any one enemy can matter.* A level with 11 expected enemies cannot put
each of them above `MinMeaningfulDanger` without running at the attrition ceiling. Thinning a level
is what buys its remaining enemies the right to be dangerous.

**Consequence 3 — health and strength are not interchangeable, even though danger can't tell them
apart.** Trading `ttk` down for `dpt` up leaves danger unchanged but changes everything about how
the fight *reads*. Health-only scaling buys danger out of fight length, which is the worst currency
available: it produces enemies that are simultaneously *"no threat at all"* and *"takes too long to
kill"*. **Prefer strength.** (Bog Shaman was once the purest example of getting this wrong: 2.3
damage per turn over 8.6 party turns.)

**Consequence 4 — the squishiest hero caps enemy strength for the whole roster.** The
`MinHitsToKillHero` check takes the party *minimum*, so one glass-cannon hero sets the ceiling on
every enemy's Strength everywhere. Raising that hero's bar is what buys strength headroom — which is
why the analyzer's own suggestion says a hero-HP change fixes many enemies at once.

## 2. What each lever actually does

| Lever | Where | Shape it produces |
|---|---|---|
| `EnemyTuning.Difficulty` | `RunLevelEntry` | Scales MaxHealth **and** Strength, so `danger ∝ d²` while `ttk ∝ d`. **Best value per turn** — the default dial. |
| `EnemyTuning.StatScales[MaxHealth]` | `RunLevelEntry` | Moves `ttk` only. Makes fights *longer*, not harder to survive. Use sparingly; see §4. |
| `EnemyTuning.Overrides` | `RunLevelEntry` | Absolute per-enemy stats. What bosses ride, so they don't move when the trash dial does — which also means **a trash buff silently breaks the boss:trash ratio unless you bump the boss too.** |
| `EnemySpawnEntry.EvaluationCount` | `RoomSO` | Multiplies the *worst-case* tail far faster than the expectation. Two entries at 2 evaluations = 4 enemies on a full roll. First thing to check on any *unwinnable spawn roll* finding. |
| `RoomsToGenerate` / room pool | `LevelDefinitionSO` | Enemy count — the only lever on per-enemy meaningfulness (§1, consequence 2). Level design, so change it deliberately. |
| Hero `BaseStats[MaxHealth]` | `HeroSO` | Raises the ceiling on every enemy's Strength at once (§1, consequence 4). |

**Difficulty vs. a MaxHealth scale, concretely:** `Difficulty 2.0` and `Difficulty 1.0 +
MaxHealth ×4.0` reach a similar danger number. The first is a 4-turn fight against something that
hurts; the second is a 8-turn fight against something that doesn't.

## 3. The workflow — measure, never guess

Do **not** hand-edit assets and re-open the window. Drive the analyzer through the Unity MCP so an
experiment is reversible and its result is a number.

The pattern (full recipe: `docs/GAMEPLAY_VALIDATION.md`; sandbox gotchas apply):

```csharp
var rules = AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath<BalanceRulesSO>(BalanceAssetCollector.RulesAssetPath)
            ?? BalanceRulesSO.CreateDefault();     // no rules asset is checked in
var report = BalanceAnalyzer.Analyze(BalanceAssetCollector.Collect(rules, false, false));
```

Then: **snapshot → mutate in memory → analyze → restore in a `finally` → re-analyze and assert the
baseline came back.** Printing the restored counts is what makes the experiment trustworthy; a
mutation that escapes the `finally` silently dirties assets.

Three things worth knowing about the harness:

- `Collect(rules, runSimulation, includeSaveAudit)` — leave both flags **false** while iterating.
  Closed-form analysis is ~1s; simulation runs hundreds of battles per encounter.
- **Levels are coupled through party growth.** `RunCurveModel` banks each floor's XP and spends it
  before measuring the next, so changing level 1 changes level 4's party. Solve **in play order**
  and iterate to a fixed point rather than tuning one level in isolation.
- **The quadratic rule makes the search cheap.** From one measurement at difficulty `d`, predict any
  other: `danger(d') ≈ danger(d)·(d'/d)²`, same for attrition. So
  `d' = d·√(target/measured)` converges in two or three iterations. Take
  `max(d_for_attrition_target, d_for_min_danger)` and clamp to the attrition ceiling.

**Verify with the suite, not just the window.** `BalanceRegressionTests` runs the same analysis as
assertions, so a tuning pass ends with the EditMode suite green (554 cases and ~1s via
`runSynchronously`).

### Watch the objective — more iterations is not better

An automated solve will happily overshoot. A run that reached **0 critical / 9 warning** at iteration
1 degraded to 13 warnings by iteration 5, because the solver kept raising one boss level's dial to
chase a per-enemy danger target and broke hero durability on the way (`Difficulty` 2.70 → 3.08, and
every hero dropped to 2 hits). **Stop at the best measured point** and check the constraints the
objective does not name — hero hits-to-kill, fight length, worst-case spawn rolls.

## 4. Retune of 2026-08-25 — findings 17 → 5

The state before: **0 critical / 17 warning / 10 info**. Fourteen of the seventeen were the same
authoring mistake, and `NEXT_STEPS.md` had recorded the wrong cause for them ("an arithmetic wall,
needs another round of thinning"). The actual cause, visible in one dump of the dials:

> **Every non-tutorial level in the project sat at `Difficulty` 1.55, and the only thing that varied
> per level was a `MaxHealth` multiplier (×1.32 … ×2.78).** Net: enemies fought at ×2.0–4.3 health
> and ×1.55 strength, campaign-wide. The campaign escalated by making enemies tankier, never more
> dangerous — §1's consequence 3, at project scale.

That is why the findings looked self-contradictory: the same Floating Eye read *"no threat at all"*
in one level and *"takes too long to kill"* in another. It also explains a subtler symptom — per-enemy
danger **falling** across a run (Eye 0.079 → 0.078 → 0.088 → 0.051 through the Drowned March), because
the party grew via the XP loop while the enemies only got more health.

What was applied — escalation moved onto `Difficulty`, all `MaxHealth` scales dropped, plus the four
coupled consequences that surfaced once the trash moved:

| Change | Closed |
|---|---|
| `Difficulty` per level: **1.80 / 2.05 / 2.70** (Threshold), **2.35 / 2.50 / 2.75 / 2.55** (Drowned March), **2.25 / 2.45** (Warrens); every `MaxHealth` scale removed | 10 × *no threat at all*, 4 × *takes too long to kill* |
| `BlueRoom` evaluations 2 → 1 on both entries — it rolled 2 Eyes + 2 Dragons and was the **only** room behind both findings | 2 × *bad spawn roll is unwinnable* |
| Boss overrides — Abyssal Warden 6/93 → **11/105**, Mirefather 8/118 → **12/126**, Gilded Hoarder 6/104 → **9/110** | 3 × *boss is only N× the level's trash* |
| Scout `MaxHealth` 22 → **30** (the party minimum, so it capped enemy Strength everywhere) | 1 × *survives only 2 ordinary hits* |
| Cinder Imp XP 8 → 14, Bog Shaman XP 16 → 10 | narrowed XP-per-danger 9.5× → 6.9× |

**Bosses had the same wrong shape as the trash.** Strength 6 on 93 HP is an 11-turn fight that never
threatens anyone. Their overrides are absolute, so they had sat still through every trash pass — the
boss:trash ratio warnings were the retune *surfacing* a pre-existing problem, not causing one.

Result: **0 critical / 5 warning / 9 info**, suite **554 / 0**. Curve `0.04 / 0.49 / 0.59 / 0.77`,
`0.44 / 0.52 / 0.34 / 0.48`, `0.56 / 0.73` — all inside the 0.80 ceiling. Trash fights **3–7** party
turns (was 3–11), worst hero case 3 hits, boss:trash **2.3 / 5.3 / 2.3**.

### The ceiling this pass found

**`Difficulty` ≈ 2.75 is the practical maximum until hero bars grow.** Pushing Rotwater Deep to 3.55
took the Warrior (26 HP) to 2 hits and put Stone Sentinel back over 8 party turns. Further escalation
is a **hero-HP** problem, not a dial problem — the same conclusion the analyzer's suggestion text
reaches from the other side. Sphere-grid growth is the intended route.

## 5. Standing traps

- **A trash buff breaks three other checks.** Boss:trash ratio (bosses are on absolute overrides),
  hero hits-to-kill (the party minimum), and worst-case spawn danger (which scales with the dial
  while the expectation barely moves). Re-read all three after any `Difficulty` change.
- **Fixing a percentage jump by raising the later level can flatten the one after it.** The curve is
  a sequence; check every jump in the run, not the one that was flagged.
- **Not every finding is a content bug.** Three of the five that remain are arguably correct as
  authored: the tutorial's single fight *should* be trivial; Bog Shaman's XP-per-danger is extreme
  because the danger index does not price healing (a model gap); and Mirefather's unresistable
  Shadow is a deliberate-or-not decision tracked in `NEXT_STEPS.md` §0c. Before tuning to silence a
  finding, decide whether the *check* is what is wrong — `MinAttritionForJumpCheck` exists because of
  exactly that call.
- **The model measures the widest legal party**, so a player fielding fewer heroes sees a harder run
  than the curve reports. Every number here is the optimistic reading.
- **No rules asset is checked in.** Everything runs on `BalanceRulesSO.CreateDefault()` unless
  someone presses *Create rules asset*. If findings ever disagree between two machines, check that
  first.
